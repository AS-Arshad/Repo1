# Cloning the SKY files

- we are obtaining the files from **kunal** sir repo and use them in diving deep and understanding with a example
- we first need to update the ubuntu
- create a new file (just to be safe and clear)
- next we are going to clone the files from kunal sir repo
- by following the promt we can clone from the repo :

- Now we can see all the files we are going to use in the following labs
## Let's explore this folder

  - lets go through the image for each step
 
    - we first created a new directory (folder) named **vlsi**
    - we then cloned the **sky** files from kunal sir's repo
    - now we can see the sky file in the vlsi directory
    - the contents of the sky has been looked at
    - note that the design and test-benches we are going to use are present inside **verilog_files** directory
    - we can notice that each design has its test-bench model
    - we can use this and understand the simulator much easier
