# Introduction to RTL design and Synthesis

In this repo we are going to understand the very basic terms and tool associated

## Introduction to Simulators

Simulators are the tools that check whether the RTL design generated through HDL is still equivalent to the specifications (specs) desired/intended

- simulators check whether the design is still maintaining the intended functionality
- we can understand that the design is still holiding the functionalities of the intended specs only after the results from the simulators
- The simulators overview can be understood by the following figure :
