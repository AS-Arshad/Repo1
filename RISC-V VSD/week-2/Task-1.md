# Introduction to BabySoC
- BabySoC is a mini version of SoC which is used for the better understanding of SoC in a smaller version making it easier to students
- Its main purpose is to make the students understand the functions of SoC
- Since SoC is a huge aspect and cannot be used in terms understanding in normal scenarious, BabySoC takes in charge of the problem
- It exhibits the same number of functionalities and applications however as a smaller version
- This helps in understanding the functionalities of SoC better, faster, efficiently and cost effectively

<summary> 1. Understanding SoC </summary>
   SoC (System on Chip) is a collections of digital modules performing various applications onto a simgle silicon chip
     Instead of needing separate parts for each function, an SoC combines everything into one small package.
     This makes it especially useful for devices where space, power, and efficiency are important, like smartphones, smartwatches, and tablets.
     Let's break down what an SoC includes and why it's essential:

  ### 1. CPU
  - Central Processing Unit, the brain of SoC that is responsible for all the working of chip like calculations, data processing and running applications
  - This handles all main instructions and decisions
