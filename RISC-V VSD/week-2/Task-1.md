# Introduction to BabySoC
- BabySoC is a mini version of SoC which is used for the better understanding of SoC in a smaller version making it easier to students
- Its main purpose is to make the students understand the functions of SoC
- Since SoC is a huge aspect and cannot be used in terms understanding in normal scenarious, BabySoC takes in charge of the problem
- It exhibits the same number of functionalities and applications however as a smaller version
- This helps in understanding the functionalities of SoC better, faster, efficiently and cost effectively
